# Lebanon_covid_19_csse
A repository containing Python code I wrote that reads CSSE time-series data for Covid-19, which I assume have already been downloaded, and extracts the data related to a specific 'Country/Region', which I took to be Lebanon. The data can then be plotted using Matplotlib and/or manipulated using the famous Python module called Pandas.
